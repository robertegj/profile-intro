## How did I make this?
Making a Github profile readme kind of feels like a bit of a trick or a hack.  
Instead of there being a setting to enable like GitHub pages, to get a profile readme:  
- Create a Repo with the same name as your username.   
- Add a Readme.md - that's where your profile is made!  
- Done! That's it.

You should see a blurb appear like `robertegj/robertegj is a special repository: its README.md will appear on your profile!` when you go to create the Readme.md
